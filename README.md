## Gameplay Overview

Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to get a hand of cards that adds up to 21, or as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The game is played between the user and the computer, which acts as the dealer. Cards have the following values:

- Number cards (2-10): Face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): Worth 10 points each.
- Ace: Worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which is more beneficial for the hand.

## How to Play

1. When the game starts, both the user and the computer are dealt two cards each.
2. The user can choose to draw another card by typing 'y' or pass by typing 'n'.
3. The computer will automatically draw cards until its score is 17 or higher.
4. The game ends when either:
   - The user or computer hits 21.
   - The user or computer exceeds 21, resulting in a loss.
   - Both players choose to stand (pass).
5. At the end of each game, the winner is determined based on the scores.

## Game Flow

1. The game begins with a prompt asking if you want to play.
2. The cards are dealt, and the user is shown their cards and the first card of the computer.
3. The user is prompted to draw another card or pass.
4. The computer automatically draws cards until its score reaches 17 or more.
5. The final scores of both the user and the computer are revealed, and a winner is declared.
6. The user is asked if they want to play again.
